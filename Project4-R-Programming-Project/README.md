# R Programming Project: Stroke Prediction Analysis

## Basic Information and Project Components

**Project**: Data analysis of stroke prediction dataset.  
**Objective**: Analyze and visualize stroke data to identify patterns and correlations.

**Tools and Techniques**:
- **R**: Data preparation, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **ggplot2**: Visualization.
- **tidyverse**: Data manipulation.

**Data Source**: [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

## Steps

### Data Preparation

1. Loaded and cleaned the stroke prediction dataset.
2. Converted necessary columns to appropriate data types.
3. Handled missing values and outliers.

### Data Analysis

1. Explored correlations between stroke and various factors (e.g., age, hypertension).
2. Used visualization techniques to identify patterns.

### Data Visualization

- Age distribution by gender and stroke status.
- Age distribution by smoking status and stroke.
- Age distribution by work type and stroke.
- BMI and age stroke correlation.
- Stroke and average glucose level comparison.
- Work type by hypertension, marital status, and stroke.

## Results and Insights

### Age Distribution

- Observed that stroke occurrence increases with age, especially in the 60+ age group.

### Hypertension and Stroke

- Identified a significant correlation between hypertension and stroke occurrence.

### Smoking Status and Stroke

- Analyzed the impact of smoking on stroke, finding that former smokers had a higher incidence of stroke.
